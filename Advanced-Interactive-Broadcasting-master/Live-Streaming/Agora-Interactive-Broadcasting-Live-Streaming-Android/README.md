With this sample app, you can:

- Join / leave channel
- Config transcoding parameters
- Start / stop RTMP streaming to CDN from Agora cloud

## Running the App

First, create a developer account at [Agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/), and obtain an App ID. Update  "app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml" with App ID.

```
<string name="app_id"><#your app id#></string>
```

Next, obtain an available push-url. Update "app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml" with push-url.

```
<string name="stream_url"><#your url#></string>
```

Then, download the **Agora SDK** from [Agora.io SDK](https://www.agora.io/en/download/). Unzip the downloaded SDK package and copy ***.jar** under **libs ** to **app/libs**, **arm64-v8a**/**x86**/**armeabi-v7a** under **libs** to **app/src/main/jniLibs**. Add the following code in the property of the dependence of the "app/build.gradle":

```
compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
```
